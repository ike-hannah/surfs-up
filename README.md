## Overview:
In an attempt to start a new chain of ice cream shops on the Island of Oahu, some information about temprature and precipitation needed to be gathered! By using an sqlite database containg the temprature and precipitation data fro the last few years, I was able to filter the data for our purposes using sqalchemy. The main challnge was getting a summary of the temprature data from the months of June and December, to see if it was going to be nice wnough for people to want to buy some delicious ice ceram.
## Results: 
The results from my analysis of June and December are as follows:
### June
* Mean temp of 74.9°F
* Min temp of 64°F
* Max temp of 85°F\

## Summary
The data looks great for ice cream sales! Most days of the year except for the very coldest days in December seem to be ice cream weather. with averages of around 70-75 all year, i think we are set up to do great buisness on the island. Two additional queries the could be perfomed are to get the average rainfall for both June and December. This would give us an overall better idea of what sales would look like those two months.
